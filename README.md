## Description
This project has selected one template from a free template website that includes Grid and Flexbox, and the challenge is to use HTML, CSS, and bootstrap to build the template. 
***The goal here is to practice HTML structure, Grid, and Flexbox, so leave the navigation with Bootstrap default behaviour and move to the next section of the page.***
